# Hi,
I am pitscher, an artist, developer and designer who likes to play and critically engage with technology.
This is my hyperlog. Other people call it a digital garden / blog / wiki whatever, but it's just a collection of interconnected text files. [Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) if you will. As I wanted to get into the habit of writing, publishing it online gives me a sense of urgency and an imaginary audience to talk to. This hopefully makes it a bit more fun.

Right now I am just focused to get it up and running, which is why I chose this jekyll [template](https://github.com/meewgumi/green-web-template). But eventually I want to make it my own and maybe move over to [sveltekit](https://github.com/franknoirot/obsidian-sveltekit-blog) as my frontend.
