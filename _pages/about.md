# Hi,
I am [pitscher](https://pitscher.net), an artist, developer and designer who likes to play and critically engage with technology.
This is my hyperlog. Other people call it their digital garden / blog / wiki or something else, but it's just a collection of interconnected text files. [Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) if you will. 
These documents serve me as a little diary as I want to start a habit of writing. I am honestly a bit scared putting my stuff out there for everyone to see. But I guess only some webscrapers are downloading it anyway. So here we go. Daily writing... or weekly.

I'll be going over some [[technical details]] of this website at some point, too.
