## Tech Stuff

Right now I am just focused to get this site up and running, which is why I chose this jekyll [template](https://github.com/meewgumi/green-web-template). But eventually I want to make it my own and maybe move over to [sveltekit](https://github.com/franknoirot/obsidian-sveltekit-blog) as my frontend.

But for now it looks like this.
I'm writing in Obsidian, pushing it to Github where it is build and served over Github actions.
